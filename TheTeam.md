## Definition of Done

### Technical Completion
-Code must be fully written, peer-reviewed, merged, and build successfully.

-Feature must pass functional validation against acceptance criteria through manual or unit testing.

Plan: Create CI/CD pipelines for fast testing and create rules on GitHub where merging requires approval from two other team members.

### UI and UX Standards 
-User interface must align with approved design specs across all devices.

-Map, search, and offline features must load within 2 seconds for local operations.

Plan: Use an already existing plant API for fast searches and run the app on multiple devices.

### Security and Data Handling
-No insecure storage of user data, especially offline.

-Deletion functions must completely clear user-cached data upon request.

Plan: Team members will run the app and to see if all data is deleted

### Feature-Specific Requirements
-Offline capabilities must be fully functional and tested.

-Downloaded plant data must be accessible without network connectivity.

Plan: Team members will try app offline to see if features work properly.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
-README files and in-app user guidance must be updated to reflect new features.

-Commit messages must be clear and linked to corresponding Trello stories.

Plan: In our weekly meetings if members don't have clear commit messages and updates on new features we will remind them to do so.

### Deployment and Review
-Feature must be deployment-ready without requiring additional fixes.

-Sprint retrospective must validate the work meets the Definition of Done or raise immediate feedback.

Plan: By using CI/CD Pipelines our features will be deployment-ready and our weekly meetings can be used to make sure the work meets the Definition of Done.
